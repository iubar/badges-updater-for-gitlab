# API - SonarQube badges into GitLab

This java application insert SonarCube badges inside projects uploaded on GitLab.

### Configuration

By the config file called "config.properties" inside this directory "src\main\resources" you have to modify the value of 3 keys:
```sh
  sonar.host = 127.0.0.1
  gitlab.host = gitlab.example.com
  gitlab.token = your_token
```
> With `sonar.host` you set up the address of the SonarQube Server

> With `gitlab.host` you set up the address of the GitLab Server

> With `gitlab.token` you set up the token for the authorization, if you have only pubblic projects you don't need this

### Run

Running the application it'll delete all the previous badges in each project, and it'll insert 7 new badges automatic generated by the address specified in the config properties file:
- Pipeline badge
- Bugs badge
- Code smell badge
- Lines of code per language badge
- Classes badge
- Functions badge
